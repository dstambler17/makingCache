HW6 Part 1 Observations and Answers
When we run the matrix file with 0 optimization and with all default parameters, we get 167,916,067 I refs and 787 misses, and 83,941,235 D refs and 1,050,434 D1 misses. We also get 1,051,221 LL refs, and 1,051,255 LLd misses.
The average time was 0.04 seconds with a 95%.

    Now we use Optimization 1:
    	Performance is slightly higher a average time is now 0.037 seconds.
	However, there are more 80%s here.
	There is no notable change in number of misses or refs
    Now we use Optimization 2
    	Performance is about the same as with optimization 0 (about 0.04 sec).
	    However, there are more 80% than with other levels.
	    The number of misses and refs is still unchanged.
    Now we use Optimization 3
      Performance is about the same as with optimization 0 (about 0.04 sec).
      Here there are about an equal number of 75% as 80% in the prev optimization.
    Now we use Optimization 4
      Performance is about 0.037 sec).
      Here there are more of 75% than previous optimizations.
Now we swap i and j

    Using Optimization 0
      much slower
      time percentage much higher - always close to 100%
      20% miss rate
    Using Optimization 1
      99% d1 miss rate
      time percentages close to 100%
      slow
    Using Optimization
      same result as above
    Using Optimization 3
      fast
      99.1% miss rate
    Using Optimization 4
      same result as previous optimization

Reverting i and j back, we now experiment the SIZE parameter
